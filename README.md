# 🔐 My First GitHub Security Project  

This is my starting point for learning **backend development** and **security practices**.  

## 📌 Goals
- Understand secure coding principles 🛡️  
- Practice authentication & authorization 🔑  
- Explore database security and safe queries 💾  
- Learn GitHub workflow for collaborative backend projects 🤝  

## 🚀 What I Did Here
- Created a branch 🌿  
- Made a secure update ✍️  
- Opened a pull request 🔄  
- Merged it myself (YOLO 🏆)  

More updates coming as I continue my **security + backend learning journey**.
